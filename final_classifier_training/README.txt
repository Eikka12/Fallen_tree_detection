This folder contains two functions:

- collectTrainingSegments
- trainFallenTreeClassifier

These two functions are part of a classifier that classifies detected fallen tree segments as true or false fallen tree segments. The first function is used for collecting training data (manually labeled tree segments). The second function uses this training data to train a classifier for distinguishing true fallen tree segments from false fallen tree segments. See the documentation of the functions for a more detailed description of the inputs and outputs as well as how the function works.
